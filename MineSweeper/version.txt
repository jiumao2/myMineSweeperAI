This is a Minesweeper Arbiter 0.52 distribution.

If you notice a bug or some weird behaviour, please report on http://www.minesweeper.info/forum/viewtopic.php?t=82

List of known bugs and other current info:

The history is contained in 'stats.dat' and 'statszini.dat' files. 'stats.dat' is compatible with earlier versions.

New arbiter.dat options:
- CounterRefresh = interval between counters refreshes, in milliseconds
- HiScorePath = path to autosave records
- HiScorePrefix = prefix for autosaved record files
- SkinAutoSwitch = enable(1)/disable(0) switching to skin written in video file
- ClearCounters = enable(1)/disable(0) counters clearing on f2/smiley
- IRCBlastedCounters = list of counters to copy into clipboard after blast, first one is _excluded_
- TrayIcon = enable(1)/disable(0) minimizing to tray 
You can tune these options through manual editing of arbiter.dat file.
- TextHistorySaveWins = enable(1)/disable(0) dumping stats of won games into texthistory.csv
- TextHistorySaveBlasts = enable(1)/disable(0) dumping stats of blasted games into texthistory.csv
- TextHistorySaveF2s = enable(1)/disable(0) dumping stats of f2ed games into texthistory.csv

Arbiter shouldn't be running when you edit arbiter.dat, or it'll overwrite it with old values on closing.

Arbiter's internals are now working in realtime. If you're +1 fan, turn on the "Recorder style timer" option in Preferences->Game Style.

Beep and restart by timer are working in realtime too. E.g., if beep setting equals '6', Arbiter will beep after 6 seconds, ie on 6.00 for those who use realtime and on 7.00 for +1-ers.

RCLK counter now works slightly different: if you make 'wasted' right click on opened number, but it's just a part of a chord, this click doesn't count as right, only as double. Also, right click counts now as effective iff it changes something on the board, i.e. misflags and unflags are now effective.

If Arbiter is lagging, try to do one of the following:
a) increase counter refresh interval:
 - open arbiter.dat in text editor
 - find the string 'CounterRefresh=4'
 - replace '4' with larger number
b) disable live counters:
 - disable Preferences->Player->Calculate Counters While Playing

If you want to watch videos in your skin (not in skin games were played), open arbiter.dat and replace SkinAutoSwitch=1' with 'SkinAutoSwitch=0'.
